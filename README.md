# Algorithms
The purpose of this repository is for a footprint of my algorithms studying following 'Top 10 algorithms in Interview Questions' posted by GeeksforGeeks website. - (reference) https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/top-10-algorithms-in-interview-questions/#algo1

# Topics: 
Graph, Linked List, Dynamic Programming, Sorting And Searching, Tree/Binary Search Tree, Number Theory, BIT Manipulation, and String/Array.
Each topic has 10 different algorithms. The core point is learning the basic structure and reorganizing the code in my way to apply the knowledge.
